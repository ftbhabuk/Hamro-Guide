#### google place api 


1.need place image url direclty from google gemeni api needs to be integrated right into api call
@@ hotel image url too... its most imp lol

2.needs to store user info from localstorage to db into json format too   ### already sotred in specal requirements category so fine 

while trip is being generated show loading button in "generate trip"  ##will do it later on okayy


after saving data to databse we should redirect to new dynamaic page eg /view-trip[dynamic] dynamic = trip id from database 



while viewing different stylings and stuffs we will create differet page for each attributes for eg.. hotelss.tsx and keep all styling for hotels there and use it as import in view trip.tsx
